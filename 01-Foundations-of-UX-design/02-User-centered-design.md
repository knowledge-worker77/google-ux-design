# User centered design
User centered design means designing products that the user wants to use. If a design that is too complex then users can be confused or annoyed and will stop using your product.
User research is the main part of user centered design, you can conduct surveys or ask the users what they want in your product and what things can be improved. This gives a clear sense of what direction should the product go and it removes any kind of designer bias that might occur.

You need to understand the end user in depth and then specify the pain points that your users have and then design a solution and then ask your users about the new version of your product.

## Getting to know your users
Before you start designing the solution to the problems that your users face you must them yourself. The goal of user research is to make sure that your product is usable by every single person that wants to use your product. 

There are a lot of questions to ask your questions but there are a lot of things that you need figure out yourself (with the help of your research).

- Do any of your users have any kind of accessibility?  
- How familiar are your users with technology? 
- What device do your users use the most?  
- Where are my users using my product?  

These questions are key to build a design that can be accessed and used by anyone.

# Assistive technology
Assistive technologies are used to help people with disabilities. Things like screen readers, voice control, and color modifications are few of the assistive technologies that we can use in our products.

Assistive design not only covers different devices or assistive technologies like screen readers but also covers people that make assistive technologies and people that have prosthetics or can't perform certain motions.

## Making designs accessible
Color modifications like high-contrast themes or dark mode help people see clearly and not put a strain on their eyes. It also help people with low or blurry vision and people that have color blindness.

Voice control allows users that have problems interacting with the screen or a keyboard or mouse navigate through the product or click a button using only their voice.

Alternate text is like adding captions for you images or visual designs. If someone has blurry vision or is blind and uses a screen reader then alternate text can describe the image for them

## Being inclusive
A lot of people in under developed countries don't have smartphones or a good internet connection and when they use a smartphone for the first time their experience should be top-notch and super simple so that they can enjoy using your product.

Universal, inclusive, and equity-focused design Universal design is the process to create a one-size fits all product. Your product should be usable by almost every single person with or without any disability or other problems.

Inclusive design means that your product is available to anyone and anywhere on any device. It should be available in all regions and should be available in all of the native languages your users might use because for most people English is a second language.

Adding support for people with disabilities or those who use any type of aiding device is called equity-focused design. It focuses on the excluded people that most people don't care about. If you use equity-focused design then you'll get more customers and your customers won't feel left out.
 
 > An example of inclusive design is Todoist. A to do list app that's available on every platform.

## Designing for different platforms
A UX designer needs to keep in mind that not every user of their product will use it on the same medium/platform as they do. 

Some people might use it on a windows machine, some might use a Mac, iPhone, android, smart TV/watch or a smart display. You need to design your product in a way that it looks good on each device and functions the same way on all platforms.

The best approach is to design for one platform at a time and use design system that matches your brand identity and then you'll have a near consistent design across all devices since there has been a huge shift in users accessing the internet from mobile devices rather than computers which gave birth to mobile-first design. 

Mobile first design is a technique in which you design for mobile devices first and make them look the same on all screen sizes and then work your way up to tablets and then desktops and laptops.
