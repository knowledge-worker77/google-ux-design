# User research
User research is the part of UX design where you ask the user what are their needs and what features they like, dislike or want in your product. 

At larger companies a UX designer is teamed up with a UX researcher and in smaller companies or design agencies the UX designer has to do both and researching skills often are required in majority of roles.

## Types of UX research
Foundational research helps to identify the main pain points of a user and helps to figure out solutions that they never thought about.

Design research is when you ask the users about how they feel using the product, is it too complex for them? How do they feel about the prototype? These questions are answered in design research.

Post research happens after the product has been launched. This helps us to find what problems are our previous and new users are facing after the latest update and what are the things that they like.

## Different methods of UX research
There are two different methods of conducting user research, the first method called primary research is conducted by yourself by interviewing users, surveys, and conducting studies.
The second type is called secondary research and it's the information that you gather from other sources like online blog posts or books or whitepapers and even videos that are similar to your product.

Collecting data about your users can also be done in two different ways:
- Quantitative data answers the 'what' and focuses on a huge number of people to gather data.
- Qualitative data answers the 'why' and focuses on smaller groups of people.

> Each research method depends upon the problem that you're trying to solve.

# Bias in UX research
A bias is favoring against something or someone based on limited information. Bias is a common hurdle when it comes to UX design. There are a total of six different types of biases that can occur in your design process and act as roadblocks in your path.

## Types of bias
- Confirmation bias is when you want to prove something is correct just because you think it is.
- False consensus is when you think that your users will think like you and are expected to use the product the way you want.
- Recency bias is when you focus on the most recent things and don't look at old research.
- Primacy bias is when you interview a certain number of people and they leave a good impression so you favor them instead of others.
- Implicit bias is when favor or dislike a certain stereotype.
- The sunk cost fallacy is another type of bias that UX designer might have and this happens when we think that we have spent a lot of time and effort into this project and it still doesn't solve the problem.
