# Design Sprint
Everything that you interact with in your daily life was once a problem and that has gone through many design iterations to become the product you're using right now.

Be it your coffee cup, dining table or any mobile application all things start with the aim of solving a problem that someone has and then someone invents a solution and then that solutions goes through many versions to become perfect.

This journey of taking a design problem and solving it in a specified amount of time is called a design sprint. The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.

A design sprint consists of five phases, understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and testing. DS saves a lot of time and create bridges between the needs of the users and the company’s goals and allow both to be completed in a short amount of time.

# Phases of a Design Sprint
A design sprint consists of five phases that most commonly take a week, each day is focused on one part of the sprint and there is a lot of creative collaboration involved.

- Understand: The first phase consists of setting the team in the right direction and discussing the problem that we are trying to solve with industry professionals and experts.  
- Ideate:  The phase begins when your team has defined the problem and now you work towards finding a solution for the problem defined in the first phase. User testing although happens in the last phase but you need to gather people that are going to volunteer in this phase.
- Decide: Each member of your team comes up with a solution and then the team decide which one would be the best one.
- Prototype: You implement the chosen solution and create a working type of the solution.
- Testing: You give the users to use or play around with the prototype to see if there is anything missing or what could be improved for the final version.

## Planning a sprint
Knowing how to plan a successful design sprint is a great skill to have this also polishes your team management skills.

The first step is user research, focus on the problem of the user and getting a rough idea of what exactly your user wants is a great start. Ask seniors and experts about how to solve your problem.

Your meeting room should be well equipped with sticky notes, whiteboards and accommodations for your team and the experts that you bring in.

## The sprint brief
A sprint brief is a document that gets handed out to all of the attendees and gets them ready for the sprint. This can include a few questions like what's the purpose of the sprint and how long it will be, who will lead it, and any required prerequisite.

## Sprint retrospective
A sprint retrospective is a meeting done immediately after the sprint is over and it’s a meeting for collaborative critique of all the things that we might have missed or done wrong in the sprint.
