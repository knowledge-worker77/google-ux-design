# Introduction
Each company wants their customers to have a great experience when they use their products and have started hiring UX designers by the dozen. UX or user experience design consists of conducting user research and designing prototypes and wire-frames.

A UX designer makes the product more enjoyable to use for the customer. The term "UX Design" was coined by Don Norman in the 1990's.

## Basics of UX design
In the modern tech world where a thousand startups open and close every day, companies need to build products that not works well but also makes the user feel at home and they enjoy using the product more and more.

For a product to have a good UX it needs to be easily usable, enjoyable, and useful to the customer. A UX designer needs to think about every single person that could use their product and cater it to their needs.

This means that a UX designer has to design the product in such a way that people of all age, education level, and even people with disabilities can use the product as it is intended to be used.

You need to conduct user surveys to ask your users how they feel about your product is there something they don't like or they want to a new feature added. These types of questions can only be answered by interacting with current and potential customers of your product.

When you provide all of things that your users want from your product their usage will increase and they'll give a positive review for your product

A satisfied customer may also use word of mouth to recommend your product which is just free marketing for you.

## Careers in the UX field
UX Design is a very broad field. It has people that are from different backgrounds and have a natural ability to create new and beautiful looking designs that are helpful to the users.
Most of the time the term "design" is associated with the visual aspect of the product by there is much more to this than meets the eye. UX designers can have sub-niches for multiple things they are expert in:

- **Interaction:** An interaction designer is one who design the whole flow of the product and how each component in the design behaves when the user access it.
- **Visual:** Visual designers are responsible for picking out what colors, icons, fonts, and images are we going to use in the project.
- **Motion:** Motion designers are responsible for videography and animations in the design to catch the attention of the user. Micro-interactions and motion designer’s work together to create the nice subtle animations that you see in most apps. 

UX designers work in a team with other people from different departments like graphic designers and UX engineers and researchers.
- Researchers: UX researchers are responsible for the text, and language that is being used in the product, they have to make sure it is simple to understand and doesn't contain any jargon to confuse the user.
- Engineers: Engineers are the ones who implement all of the designs into a working prototype.

## Product life cycle
The lifecycle of a product, be it a website or app is the process of taking an idea and making it into a real product. The lifecycle consists of five stages:
- Brainstorm: The first stage is to gather everyone and think of possible solutions to the problem at hand. In this stage we learn more deeply about the problem and the audience.
- Define: The second stage is where we organize and define all of the findings that we did in stage one. This narrows down the problem into what really needs to be fixed and what features are going to be added in our product.
- Design: The third stage is where the UX designers come into play and design a prototype or line mockup from all the specifications they receive. 
- Test: After designing a prototype the team test the product thoroughly and removes any bugs that they find in the testing phase and add the final touches.
- Deployment: The final stage of the product lifecycle is the deployment stage where the product is available to user to try and give feedback for improvements.

## Good user experience
Your main goal as a UX designer is to create easy to use and enjoyable experiences for all of your users and knowing how to do that is the main thing.

Start looking at normal everyday things like doors and the escalator at the mall, think how you can improve the UX of these things. For an example you can label the sides of the door with a sticker that tells the person opening the door that the need to push or pull.

If you can find the flaws in the UX of everyday objects then you can find them also in your products.
