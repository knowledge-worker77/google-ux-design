# User ideation
Ideation is the process of coming up with different ways to solve a particular problem. The more ideas you have the more creative you can get.  

You and your team can brainstorm as many ideas as possible and note each one down on a sticky note or a journal. 

Your ideas should also be aligned with your company's business models and needs. The total budget, pricing models and design choices should be aligned with the business's personality.

# Different ways to come-up with solutions

## Using the HMW technique
The how might we method is used to ideate solutions during the ideation phase the phrase: How might we followed by a question allows your brain to think specifically to find solutions on how to solve the problem and the more creative ideas you'll get the more out-of-the-box ideas will come to you.

## Scoping the competition
A competitive audit is a report of your products direct and indirect competitors to see how they handle their business and what tactics or marketing campaigns have worked for them and which one has failed.

Direct competitors will target the same audience as yours with a similar product like yours meanwhile indirect competitors will sometimes have a similar product but target audience will be different and vice versa.

Make sure to find out whatever is lacking or not up-to the mark in your competitors products and then add them into your product but don't copy the whole thing. Even if something worked for them it might not work for you as your trying to build an overall better product.

## Conducting a competitive audit
The first step in a competitive audit is to make your goal as clear as possible and make sure your team knows it. It could be you want to boost sales or make short term user’s long term, whatever it is it should be clear and concise.

Next you need to make chart listing everything about the competitors. A spreadsheet is preferred but you can use a white board or sticky notes as well. Step three includes marking out the specific aspects between both the products.

Step four includes doing research about the similar aspects and how the competitor’s product is different from yours. In the final step is to analyze all of your findings and try to find patterns or recurring themes in both products.

## Crazy eights
Crazy eights are eight drawings or sketches on a single piece of paper that we draw using a pencil or marker after we come up with multiple ideas and then pick out the top eight ideas. 
Sketching on paper rather than doing it digitally is preferred because it allows for more creative freedom and is a lot faster than sketching on a computer or tablet.
