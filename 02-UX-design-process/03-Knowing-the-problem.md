# Problem and Hypothesis statements
A problem statement is clear and simple definition of the users’ needs that we need to address using our products. They allow team members to focus on what is more important and provide a clear goal on what features to ship or improve first. A problem statement should also contain some information about the user like a mini persona.

A hypothesis statement is the possible solution that you come up with for the problem statement. Hypothesis statements sometimes start with an *If, then* statements. If something happens then our product should do this is a generic If, then statement which helps UX designers to come up with solutions to problem statements.

# Things to keep in mind

## Value Proposition
A value proposition is when finish defining a user’s problems and then compare your product offerings to the problem. You value proposition depends upon why should the customer use your product.

Value propositions are the reason people will buy your products instead of other products. What does your product have that others don't? What makes your product better than others? These questions are needed to be answered to create a great value proposition for your product.

## The human factor
When designing a product one of the things to always keep in mind is that your product will be used by humans. Humans are not trained machines that'll use the product as intended.

Some will already have experience using similar products and will start using your product immediately while some will get used to it and some will have to learn how to use it.

If you design is simple for everyone to use, isn't complex, and allows anyone to complete their work without any disturbance then you'll receive positive feedback but if at any point in the user journey he is stopped he will give a negative or neutral review which you would need to turn into a positive one.

## Psychological influences
