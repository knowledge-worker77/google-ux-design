# The UX Design Process 
The user experience design process starts from getting to know about your user and empathizing with them then defining their problems to your team and finally coming up with ideas on how to solve the user’s problems.

## Empathize with Users
Empathizing with your users means that you understand their feelings and emotions and how they feel about yours or any other product.
Empathy Maps

An empathy map is a simple chart that contains all the details that we have learned about the user. An empathy map learns how the user feels and what they say, do, and think about their problems.

A single empathy map contains information from a single user while a aggregated empathy map contains data from a diverse group of people each having their own problems and feelings.

Each segment of people that you interview should have a different empathy map and then combine relevant segments to form aggregated empathy maps.
Identify Pain Points

Before you get ready to solve problems, you need to make sure that your users actually have that problem. You need to learn what needs a user has and what need they don't have. Because sometimes people themselves don't know that they could benefit from something if it was given to them.

Your users pain points no matter how many they are they always fall into these categories:

- Financial: This is when the user can't afford the product or the product is free but keeps asking to buy the premium plan and it kind of is irritating when you’re working.
- Product: This type of pain point is what UX designers are skilled at removing. Product pain points mean that the UX of the product is not great for user and needs to improve because the user keeps having the same problem over and over again.
- Process: These pain points occur when the user is trying to something with your product but keeps getting interrupted by paywalls or ads that stop him working and create hurdles in his path.

## Creating persona's and journey maps
User personas are fictional characters that you make from the research that you do. A persona helps give the research character and user case study can be made using a persona.  A user journey is the process of how the user experiences your product and what are the things that and what troubles does he encounter.
