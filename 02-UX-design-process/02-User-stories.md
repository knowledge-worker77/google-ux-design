# User Stories
A user story is a story that you make up using the persona that you created. The story is created using the persona's point of view and not yours and is mostly short or one-sentenced.

> User stories are sometimes called scenarios but mean the same thing

User stories are helpful for getting a deeper understanding about your users and helps you to prioritize the features that are the most important. User stories are also important for showing shareholders and potential investors how your product is user-centric. 

A good user story is like a fairy tale, It has a hero a that has to perform some task but there are many troubles along his path to be complete his task. You are the one who guides him and makes his journey easier.

> A user story must contain a user that wants to do an action which benefits him in some way.

## User story maps
Before you start any kind of journey you need a map to guide you. A user journey map is made from the personas and stories that you have made.

A journey map is exactly like a regular map as it shows how and what a user has to go through to complete his goal.

# Edge cases
An edge case happens if your user has a specific requirement and your app doesn't support it. Or sometimes the user doesn't have the required device to use your app.

If you want to make sure that your product works for all users and edge cases are just the thing to make sure it does. Edge cases are unexpected or rare situations that sometimes can interrupt the user from doing their work. 

The best way to handle edge cases is to do testing before launching, but keep in mind that even if the product is live sometimes an edge case might appear and some of them are just unsolvable.
