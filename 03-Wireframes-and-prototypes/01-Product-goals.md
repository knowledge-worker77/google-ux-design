# Product goal statements
A product goal statement is a short description of all the empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps that helps us to focus our design to a set of problems and that we don't lose focus on what's more important.

A goal statement defines the ideal solution for the design, the problem is defined in the problem statement and the solution in the goal statement. It cover what a user can do with the product, who does it affect and why product affects users in a positive way and how much is the products effectiveness.

## Creating user flows
A user flow is the path taken by a typical user on an app or website so they can complete a task from start to finish. A user map shows how a typical user will navigate through your app and this allows us to make our navigation UX simpler and easier for users.
Storyboards and user flows

Creating a story board is a great way to ideate and outline the ideal flow for your design. A story board is a series of panels or frames that tell a story about how the app should be navigated.

A storyboard consists of four key elements, the character, the scene, the plot, and the narrative. The character represents your user and the scene represents the user's environment and where he is at currently. The plot describes the benefit of the design and the narrative describes what problem does the user have and how can our design help him.

A typical storyboard consists of six panels and each of them have supporting captions.
There are two different kinds of storyboards that UX designers use. There are big-picture storyboards that give us a broad view of the user's experience with our product and what problems are they facing. The second one is called the close-up storyboard focuses on the design of the product rather than the user and how the user navigates through our design to complete his task.

# Design fidelity
A design has different levels of fidelity. Fidelity means how close the design is to the actual product. A low-fidelity design is just a quick idea of how the product should look like and are mostly used in the ideation phase of the UX design process.

High-fidelity design are very much close to the final design and are more interactive than a low-fidelity design and are used in the prototype phase of the UX design process.

Wireframes are basic outlines of the design and only show how and where components should be placed and are used to make the basic structure of designs.
