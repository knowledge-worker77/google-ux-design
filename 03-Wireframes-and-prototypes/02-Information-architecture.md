# Information Architecture
Information architecture is how information is displayed out in your design.  IA helps to organize the content in your designs and makes navigation easier for the user. The more research you do the more ways you'll learn to make the information architecture of your app easier.

> Information architecture is like a treasure map, you need to guide your user to the X mark.

A good information architecture is built using these three things.  

- Organization: How different pieces of information are organized in your app.
- Hierarchy: This shows what should the user focus on first and creates a tree like structure to organize data and sub-data. 
- Sequence: The order in which the user should go through your design.  Information architecture is also a great way to create sitemaps for websites and mobile apps. 

# Basic principles of IA
There are eight basics principles of good information architecture that were created by Dan Brown the founder of EightShapes. These principles help UX designers to understand their products and make decisions accordingly.

## Objects and choices
According to the object principle, You should view your content as “living” and as something that changes and grows over time. And, the choice principle believes that people think they want to have many choices, but they actually need fewer choices that are well-organized.

## Disclosure and examples
According to the disclosure principle the information that is shown to the user should not be unexpected or unnecessary and the exemplar priciples says that humans put things into categories and group different concepts together.  So if you have a product that is kind of similar to another product that people are already aware of then your product will become familar to them as well.

## The front door and design growth
These two priciples talk about that if your product is a web-based product or has multiple entrance points then you need to make all of  them the same way you made the main entrance point. (This isn't applicable to mobile apps since they only have a single entrace point.)

The growth priciples talks about how designs grow overtime and if you don't organize them in way that is most productive for you and the user then soon you'll be overwhelmed with the complexity of the design and the user would just quit due to the amount wasted due to the complex design. 

## Focused search
The foucused search principle talks about that different people will look for different information on your website according to thier own style of searching. Whatever way they choose they will be highly focused when searching so the search functionality must be simple and to the point and shouldn't interupt the user in any way.


# Analog and Digital Wireframes
Creating wireframes of your designs on papers is the quickest and easiest way to get started with your designs. Wireframes allow you design the basic structure of your app that you are designing.

Digital wireframes allow for more flexibility as oppose to paper wireframes. They can look somewhat better than the paper wireframes and also can be interactive so you can create user flows and interactive dialogs to show what would happen if the user clicked on a button.

## Gestalt principle
Gestalt principles are used to describe how humans form connections between shapes and patterns that are similar looking and simplify complex images to better understand them.

By grouping similar items together in your designs you can add a visually pleasing affect for your users. Things like similarity between components, icons, and the distance between them affects how a user feels about your app's design.
