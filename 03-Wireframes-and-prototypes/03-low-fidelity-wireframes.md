# Low-fidelity prototypes

A low-fidelity prototype is the next step in your UX design's life. You first make wireframes on paper then you transfer them to your UX design software and then we add interactivity into those wire frames and this is called a low-fidelity prototype.

A low-fidelity prototype defines which screen comes first and how users can navigate between different screens and interact with dialogs and forms

## Don't deceive your users

Whenever you go to a website you'll always see a popup saying that you should sign up for their newsletter and get a discount coupon or flash deals that expire in 5 minutes or random products being added into your cart. These are all wrong practices to get something from the user and this will end up with the user having a terrible experience and won't visit your site or try to avoid it.

A UX designer's job is to make sure that users are attracted to products that they design but this doesn't mean that you should use unfair means. Always do the right thing as this will be rewarded in the future.

Each business out there wants to hog all the attention of its customers and it's your job as a designer and a user that you don't use any unfair means and make sure that your users get the best experience possible.
